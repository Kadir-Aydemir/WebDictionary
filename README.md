## About The Project
 <img src="https://github.com/Kadir-Aydemir/WebDictionary/blob/main/Resources/explore/dp home.JPG" alt="Logo" width="1000" height="450">


WebDictionary: As the name suggests, it is a Dictionary application. I developed it as a completely English interface. It is a platform where you can freely create headings and content in today's standards. You can browse the site, review the heading and content without being a member. After you become a member, you can create the heading you want in the category you want, with pictures, within the framework of the Dictionary rules. You can write content for the headings you want, you can like the content written by other writers. You can edit the headings and contents you created from Writer Panel. You can see the statistics of other writers in the Dictionary, access the headings and content they have created, and chat with other writers . There is an advanced summernote for creating messages and you can send messages to each other in any format you want. The Dictionary is sensitive to human values ​​and if this sensitivity is not followed, it can be blocked for a certain period of time. It consists of 4 panels: Dictionary Panel, Writer Panel, Admin Panel and Showcase. You can access information about the project and me by clicking the Showcase button on the Writer Panel.
